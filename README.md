Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course fourteen: Backtracking

Definition: Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.

Problem backtracking3 :Generate, display and count all solutions: all strings formed by the first k lowercase letters of length n
  example: n= 3, k= 3
//aba
//ccc
//abc
